# sdisk2util_linux
dsk2nic and nic2dsk command line utils

These are derived from the code in sdisk2util by by Koichi Nishida
It was converted from C++ to simple C and all the Windows GUI was stripped out and made into simple command line utils.
Implementations of filename manipulation are extremely simplistic and no bounds or error checking is done.
Use at own risk.  Likely to segfault on bad input.
